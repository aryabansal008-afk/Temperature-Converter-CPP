# Temperature-Converter-CPP
A modular C++ console application implementing accurate bidirectional temperature conversions between Celsius, Fahrenheit and Kelvin with absolute zero validation and function based design.

## 🔍 Overview
This project is a modular, menu driven C++ console application that performs accurate temperature conversions between Celsius, Fahrenheit and Kelvin. The program uses dedicated conversion functions, predefined constants and structured control flow to ensure clarity and maintainability while delivering precise floating point calculations.
It also enforces physical constraints by validating inputs against absolute zero for each temperature scale, preventing invalid values. 

This project demonstrates fundamental programming concepts such as functional decomposition, conditional logic, switch-case control structures and clean console based user interaction.
